# ADG
ADG (Architectural Decision Guidance) is a command-line tool written in Go for modeling, managing, and reusing architectural decisions in a lightweight and structured way.

An architectural decision is a justified design choice addressing a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant. These decisions can be captured using Architectural Decision Records (ADRs). ADG allows you to create and edit ADRs, group them into *models*, and manage those models. A model can be created, copied, imported, or merged, providing guidance for recurring decisions.

## Getting started

To start using ADG, you can either download the [latest release](https://github.com/adr/ad-guidance-tool/releases) or build it from source.

### Downloading a release

Precompiled executables for major operating systems are available:
- Windows: `adg_win.exe`
- Linux: `adg_linux`
- macOS (Intel): `adg_mac_intel`
- macOS (Apple Silicon): `adg_mac_arm`

> For convenience, feel free to remove the suffix (e.g., `_win`) after you have downloaded the file.

### Building from source

To build ADG yourself, ensure that [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) is installed on your system. Then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adr/ad-guidance-tool.git
cd ad-guidance-tool
go build
```
This will generate a binary in your current directory called `adg` (or `adg.exe` on Windows).

### Running the tool

Executing the binary displays the CLI help:

```
CLI tool for managing architectural decision records and models

Usage:
  adg [command]

Available Commands:
  add          Adds one or more decision points to a model
  comment      Add a comment to a decision
  copy         Copies a model, optionally a subset based on filters
  decide       Marks a decision as decided by selecting one of its options
  edit         Edit a decision file
  help         Help about any command
  import       Imports a decision model into an existing model
  init         Initializes a new model
  link         Link two decisions using optional custom tags or default precedes/succeeds logic
  list         Lists decisions in the model, optionally filtering by tag, status, title, or ID
  merge        Merges two decision models into a new target model
  rebuild      Rebuilds the index file for the given model
  reset-config Reset all configuration (or only template headers with --template)
  revise       Creates a copy of a decision and resets its status to 'open' (if not already)
  set-config   Set persistent configuration values
  tag          Categorizes a decision by adding one or more tags to its metadata
  validate     Validate the models decisions by checking if the files match the index file
  view         Show the full or partial content of one or more decision files

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for adg

Use "adg [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### Shell auto-completion

To enhance your workflow, ADG supports shell auto-completion. Generate a script with:

```bash
adg completion [shell]
```

For example, to enable auto-completion in PowerShell:

```bash
adg completion powershell
```

Copy the output into your [PowerShell profile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_profiles?view=powershell-7.5) to enable completions. Follow a similar process for other shells (available: `bash`, `fish`, `powershell`, `zsh`).

## User Guide

### Creating a new model

To create a new decision model, use the `init` command:

```bash
adg init <model-name>
```

This creates a new directory (in your current working directory, unless an absolute or relative path is provided) containing an `index` file. This index tracks metadata for all decisions in the model and is continuously updated as decisions change.

### Adding and editing a decision

To add a new decision to the model:

```bash
adg add --model <model-name> --title <decision-title>
```

This generates a new Markdown file inside the model directory. Each new file includes a metadata block followed by three sections: *Question*, *Options*, *Criteria*.

You can edit these sections manually in a text editor, or using the `edit` command of the tool:

```bash
adg edit --model <model-name> --id <decision-id | decision-title> [--question "<section-content>"] [--option "<option-name>"] [--criteria "<section-content>"]
```

> The `--option` flag is repeatable for adding multiple options. Each option is automatically given an anchor tag so it can be referenced.

If you're editing manually, ensure the structure matches the following format:
```markdown
---
adr_id: "0001"
title: your-title
status: open
tags: []
links: []
comments: []
---

## <a name="question"></a> Question

<!-- section content -->

## <a name="options"></a> Options

1. <a name="option-1"></a> Option 1
2. <a name="option-2"></a> Option 2
3. <a name="option-3"></a> Option 3
<!-- and so on -->

## <a name="criteria"></a> Criteria

<!-- section content -->
```

You may change the displayed section header and/or include additional sections, but the tool expects at least the three sections and their anchor tags mentioned above to function properly.

For example:

```markdown
---
adr_id: "0001"
title: your-title
status: open
tags: []
links: []
comments: []
---

## <a name="question"></a> Context and Problem Statement
<!-- section content -->

## <a name="options"></a> Considered Options
1. <a name="option-1"></a> This is my first considered option
2. <a name="option-2"></a> This is my second considered option
<!-- and so on -->

## <a name="criteria"></a> Decision Drivers
<!-- section content -->

## Pros and Cons of the Options
<!-- section content -->

```

### Deciding on an option

To mark a decision as decided:

```bash
adg decide --model <model-name> --id <decision-id | decision-title> --option <option-number | option-title> [--rationale "your-rationale"] 
```

This will add a new section **Outcome** pointing out the chosen option and a rationale if provided to the command.

### Config

You can customize ADG's behavior using:

```bash
adg set-config [flags]
```
> Run with `-h` to see available configuration flags.

By default configuration is stored in a file called `.adgconfig.yaml` located in your home directory. You can specify a custom path using the `--config-path` flag.

To reset all configuration values (and use the default configuration path again):

```bash
adg reset-config
```

### Example Model

In the [models/clean](/models/clean/) directory, you'll find a sample model containing common architectural decisions based on **Clean Architecture**.

You can use this model as a starting point to get familiar with the tool by copying it:

```bash
adg copy --model models/clean --target <new-model-name>
```

For more commands see the help text output:
```bash
adg -h            # for a general overview
adg <command> -h  # for a specific command
```

## Contributing

If you have a feature request or found a bug, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/adr/ad-guidance-tool/issues) to share your feedback.

Contributions are also welcome. Please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/adr/ad-guidance-tool/pulls) with your changes.

We follow [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) to organize our codebase. If you're adding a feature, we recommend to:
1. Start with the use case (interactor) of your feature
2. Add any necessary core logic in the domain layer
3. Implement the [Cobra CLI command](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) for input and a *presenter/printer* for output
4. Write unit tests (refer to existing tests for guidance). To simplify mocking, we use [mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery), though hand-written mocks are also possible.
